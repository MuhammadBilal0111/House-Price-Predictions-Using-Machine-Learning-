# House Price Detection using Machine Learning
This is a repository that demonstrates how to predict house prices using machine learning. We use the Scikit-Learn library to build a predictive model.

# Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have the following libraries installed:
```shell
numpy: NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python.
matplotlib: Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language.
scikit-learn: Scikit-Learn is a machine learning library for Python.
StandardScaler: StandardScaler is used for feature scaling in machine learning.
You can install these libraries using pip:
```

```shell
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```
Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-detection.git
```
cd house-price-detection
Usage
This project contains a Python script for house price detection using machine learning. The main script is house_price_detection.py.

Here is a basic example of how to use the script:

python
Copy code
python house_price_detection.py
Data
The data used for this project should be placed in the data directory. Make sure to organize your data appropriately before running the script.

## Features
House Price Prediction: The script uses a machine learning model to predict house prices based on the provided data.
