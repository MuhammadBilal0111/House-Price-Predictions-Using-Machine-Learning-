# House Price Detection using Machine Learning
This is a repository that demonstrates how to predict house prices using machine learning. We use the Scikit-Learn library to build a predictive model.

# Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

numpy: NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python.
matplotlib: Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language.
scikit-learn: Scikit-Learn is a machine learning library for Python.
StandardScaler: StandardScaler is used for feature scaling in machine learning.
You can install these libraries using pip:


```shell
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Data
The data used for this project should be placed in the data directory. Make sure to organize your data appropriately before running the script.

## Features
House Price Prediction: The script uses a machine learning model to predict house prices based on the provided data.
